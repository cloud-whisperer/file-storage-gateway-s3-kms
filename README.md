# file-storage-gateway-s3-kms

This repository demonstrates how to set up an AWS Storage Gateway with an SMB file share, focusing on secure data storage and access.
One is able to gain hands-on knowledge by configuring a file share, defining permissions, and creating an IAM role
which allows an S3 bucket to be accessed and a file image to be uploaded.
